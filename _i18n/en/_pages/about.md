Welcome to the H!NT (**H**uman-machine **I**nteraction & **N**a**T**ural language understanding) Lab! H!NT is a research laboratory newly created in 2023, and is headed by Professor Pinpin Zhu, collaborated with Assistant Professor Hao Wang. We are primarily based at [School of Computer Engineering and Science (CES)](https://cs.shu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/) .


**Research synopsis**: Our principal research interests lie in the development of deep learning and cognitive methodology, and large-scale computational system and architecture, for solving problems involving human-machine communication, natural language processing, and multimodal media or documents in state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) systems.

The laboratory focuses on cutting-edge issues in the field of artificial intelligence industry implementation, with a strong academic atmosphere and a research environment that allows for freedom and flexibility. It possesses ample computing resources.

Currently, the laboratory is primarily composed of students with a background in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, we also welcome students with interdisciplinary backgrounds in fields such as psychology, linguistics, and cognitive science to join the laboratory.
