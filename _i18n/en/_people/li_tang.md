## Introduction
I am Tang Li. I got my BS degree from Taiyuan University of Technology. I am currently is a master's student enrolled in the year of 2021 at the School of Computer Engineering and Science, Shanghai University, under the supervision of Dr. Hao Wang. My main research interests are multi-modal few-shot learning, incremental learning, and continuous learning. 


I focus on the problme of few-shot learning for visually rich document understanding. Specifically, within a single domain, there is a problem of huge data categories and unbalanced number of data in each category (long-tailed distribution), which is mainly solved by few samples and variational self-encoder or diffusion model. In visual rich documents, there are document comprehension problems caused by domain mismatch between multiple domains due to inconsistent board styles, which are mainly solved by class incremental learning and continuous learning. He is introverted, doesn't talk much, but will be very SD when he gets familiar with it, and his hobby is eating and playing games. I hope to find a job in the future.
